## Hi, my name is Łukasz Michalak
Currently, I am continuing my studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology at the Faculty of Computer Science, where I specialize in data science. As part of my studies, I deal with data analysis, machine learning and neural networks. I also learn tools and techniques used in data processing, which allows me to develop the skills of creating predictive models and making decisions based on data.
