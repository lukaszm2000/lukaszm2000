## Hi, my name is Łukasz Michalak 👋
Currently, I am continuing my studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology at the Faculty of Computer Science, where I specialize in data science. As part of my studies, I deal with data analysis, machine learning and neural networks. I also learn tools and techniques used in data processing, which allows me to develop the skills of creating predictive models and making decisions based on data.


Here are some projects that show my interests and skills in various areas of Data Science


## Projects
### 1. **Brain Tumor Classification and Detection using Neural Networks** *(Master's thesis, to be published soon)* 

### 2. **[Apartment Price Prediction with Data Scrapping](https://github.com/lukaszm2000/ApartmentPricePredictionScrapping)**

### 3. **[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/lukaszm2000/CarPricePrediction)**

### 4. **[Cinema Database Project (PLSQL & T-SQL)](https://github.com/lukaszm2000/CinemaReservationSystem)**

My interests:
- 📊 Data analysis and visualization.
- 🤖 Machine learning and artificial intelligence.
